I have established my funding within the expanding field of interdisciplinary research that focuses on the interactions of agriculture, nutrition, and health in low-income countries. The interdisciplinary nature of my research is reflected in the diverse sources of funding within the Global Challenges Research Funds initiative from FCDO, ESRC, EPSRC and non-profit sector.
