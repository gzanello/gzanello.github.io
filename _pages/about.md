I am an Associate Professor in Food Economics and Health, Head of the Agri-Food Economics and Marketing Department, and Deputy Director of the Graduate Institute for International Development, Agriculture and Economics at the [University of Reading](http://www.reading.ac.uk/apd/staff/g-zanello.aspx) (UK). I am also a Fellow at the [London Centre for Integrative Research on Agriculture and Health](https://lcirah.ac.uk/) (London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine) and I currently serve as a core member of the Independent Expert Group for the [Global Nutrition Report](https://globalnutritionreport.org/about/independent-expert-group/).

My own work has been concentrated on efforts to understand how agriculture, food, nutrition, and health interact in low- and middle-income countries. I am currently interested in assessing the energy requirements of farmers and capturing the effects of agricultural practices on health and nutrition.

Previously I was a research fellow at the [London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/) supporting the work of the [Global Panel on Agriculture and Food Systems for Nutrition](https://www.glopan.org/) in its commitment to tackling global challenges in food and nutrition security.

From 2012 to 2015 I was a research officer at Oxford Universityâ€™s [Department of International Development](https://www.qeh.ox.ac.uk/). As part of the [Technology and Management for Development Centre](https://www.oxfordtmcd.org/), I did research on the diffusion of innovations in low-income countries.
