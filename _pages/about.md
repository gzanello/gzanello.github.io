I am a Professor in Food Economics and Health and Head of the [Agri-Food Economics and Marketing Department](https://www.reading.ac.uk/agri-food-economics-marketing/) at the [University of Reading](http://www.reading.ac.uk/apd/staff/g-zanello.aspx) (UK). From 2019 to 2024 I served as Deputy Director of the University of Reading's [Graduate Institute for International Development, Agriculture and Economics](https://www.reading.ac.uk/apd/giidae).

My research research lies at the intersection of food systems, nutrition, and development, with a particular focus on low- and middle-income countries.

I currently serve as Co-Chair of the Independent Expert Group for the [Global Nutrition Report](https://globalnutritionreport.org/about/independent-expert-group/).

Previously I was at the [London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/) supporting the work of the [Global Panel on Agriculture and Food Systems for Nutrition](https://www.glopan.org/) in its commitment to tackling global challenges in food and nutrition security. From 2012 to 2015 I was a research officer at Oxford University’s [Department of International Development](https://www.qeh.ox.ac.uk/). As part of the [Technology and Management for Development Centre](https://www.oxfordtmcd.org/), I conducted research on the diffusion of innovations in low-income countries.
