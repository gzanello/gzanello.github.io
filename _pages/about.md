I am a Professor in Food Economics and Health and Head of the [Agri-Food Economics and Marketing Department](https://www.reading.ac.uk/agri-food-economics-marketing/) at the [University of Reading](http://www.reading.ac.uk/apd/staff/g-zanello.aspx) (UK). From 2019 to 2024 I served as Deputy Director of the University of Reading's [Graduate Institute for International Development, Agriculture and Economics](https://www.reading.ac.uk/apd/giidae).

My research focuses on the interactions between agriculture, food, nutrition, and health in low- and middle-income countries. I am particularly interested in assessing the energy requirements of farmers and understanding the impacts of agricultural practices on health and nutrition. More recently, my work has expanded to include the analysis of food systems and food environments.

I currently serve as Co-Chair of the Independent Expert Group for the [Global Nutrition Report](https://globalnutritionreport.org/about/independent-expert-group/).

Previously I was at the [London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/) supporting the work of the [Global Panel on Agriculture and Food Systems for Nutrition](https://www.glopan.org/) in its commitment to tackling global challenges in food and nutrition security. From 2012 to 2015 I was a research officer at Oxford Universityâ€™s [Department of International Development](https://www.qeh.ox.ac.uk/). As part of the [Technology and Management for Development Centre](https://www.oxfordtmcd.org/), I conducted research on the diffusion of innovations in low-income countries.
